  <h3>Chrome Update Issue</h3>
  <section class="padding-1">
    <p>There is currently a issue with Chrome that impacts ALL extensions. Right after an update, extensions can <span
        class="emphasis">just stop working.</span> There are two user workaround.</p>
    <p>The first is to restart Chrome.</p>
    <p>The second is to go to <code>Manage Extensions</code> under the
      puzzle piece in the Chrome toolbar. Then enable <code>Developer mode</code> and manually reload the extension.
    </p>
    <p class="is-center"><img alt="how to manually reload an extension" src="img/chrome_update_bug.png"><br/></p>
    <p>Hopefully this will be fixed soon and only seems to show up after the extension is modified.
      See
      <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1271154" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Issue
        #1271154 ↗</a> for more information. But this trick is handy for all extensions until it's resolved.</p>

  <h3>Reporting other issues</h3>
  <section class="padding-1">
    Any problems or feature requests should be reported here via a
    <a href="https://github.com/trophygeek/universalvideomaximizer/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub
      issue ↗</a>. Chrome's reporting feature in the store does not notifying when new issues are added.
  </section>

  <section class="padding-1">
    As always, this extension is:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="emphasis bold">FREE</span>

      <li>Prompts for permissions to increase security and maintain your privacy.
      </li>

      <li><span class="emphasis">NEVER collects ANY data</span>. Privacy is a top priority.
      </li>

      <li>Is <a href="https://github.com/trophygeek/universalvideomaximizer/" rel="noopener"
                target="_blank">open-sourced ↗</a> for transparency.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>New playback speed option</h3>
  <section class="padding-3">
    Playback speed cannot work on pages where videos are actually hosted on a different site without extra permissions
    prompt (e.g. youtube videos not on the youtube site). This appears to be a limitation of the Chrome APIs but may
    improve in future versions.<br/>
    <br/>
    If the <span class="emphasis bold">speed controls don't work</span> or the layout isn't centered, then <span
      class="emphasis bold">unzoom and rezoom</span> to see if you get another permissions prompt.
  </section>


  <section class="padding-5">
    <img alt="screen shot" class="illustration" src="img/new_speed_control_bar.png">
    After zooming, clicking the Video Maximizer button shows extra options to control playback speed.
  </section>


  <h3>Why speed control fails on some sites</h3>
  <section class="padding-3">
    <img alt="screen shot" class="illustration" src="img/permissions_prompt.png">
    When pages load their videos from a different site (e.g. a youtube video embedded in a non youtube site), then
    the speed control feature will not work without permissions to both sites.<br/><br/>
    If this happens, you can try rezooming a couple of times and see if more Access prompts show up. Yes, the
    reprompting can be annoying, but it's just a how Chrome works and you will only be prompted once per site.
    If you grant permissions, then you will NOT be prompted again.<br/><br/>
    If you continue to have access issues or find the prompting annoying there are extra permissions you can try
    in the Video Maxmizer Options page.<br/><br/>
    "Allow access to all sites by default" in the <a href="options.html" target="videomaxoptions">Options</a> will
    increase this extension's base permissions.<br/><br/>
    The fundamental issue is how the cross-domain-frame-permissions-granting works in Chrome. See <a
      href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=826433" rel="noopener"
      target="_blank">Issue #826433 ↗</a>

  <h3>
    Known issues
  </h3>
  <section class="padding-7">
    <h4>Youtube controls are not fullscreen</h4>
    <p>The solution for this is to put the youtube video into "theater" mode before using Video Maximizer. This can be
      done by pressing the "t" key.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Skipping doesn't work on Netflix</h4>
    <p>Skipping the video backwards on netflix causes an error. There's no workaround, so this feature is just disabled
      for now.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Speed controls don't work on some sites</h4>
    <p>Video Maximizer attempts to use the minimal permissions required to do it's job. However, there are still some
      sites that require more access to work.
      (The technical reason has to do with embedding iframes that have cross-domain references.)</p>
    <p>The default settings for Video Maximizer is maximium privacy, if you come across a site that you use that
      requires more permissions to work, open a bug and I'll investigate. See the Options page for more choices to grant
    this extension more permissions.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Disabling "Allow access to all sites by default" doesn't reset permissions</h4>
    <p>Another Chrome issue. Video Maximizer removes the extra permissions; however, since they've already been granted,
      it seems like the extension must be uninstalled and reinstalled to reset it.</p>

    <br/>
    <h4>Constant security prompting</h4>
    <p>You should only get prompted ONCE per unique site you use Video Maximizer on; however, if this annoys you, then
      you have the choice to enable the "Allow access to all sites by default" option. You will then get one last prompt
      and never be bugged again.</p>
