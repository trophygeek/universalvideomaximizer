  <h3 id="newdesign">New playback features</h3>
  <section class="padding-3">
    <span class="emphasis bold"> Why include playback controls?</span><br>
    Video Maximizer does its best to include the original playback controls when zooming, but
    some sites may still fail and end up missing them. That's when having some basic playback controls as part of
    Video Maximizer comes in handy.
  </section>
  <section class="padding-2">
    The feature allows: pause, skip and speed control directly from the extension.
  </section>

  <section class="padding-2">
    On pages where videos are actually hosted on a different site, it may require a <i>second</i> permissions prompt
    (e.g. misc sites embedding youtube videos). This appears to be a limitation of the Chrome APIs but
    hopefully will improve in future versions.<br/>
    <br/>
    If the <span class="emphasis bold">speed controls fail</span> or the layout isn't centered, then <span
      class="emphasis bold">unzoom and rezoom</span> to see if you get another permissions prompt.
  </section>

  <section class="padding-2">
  Permissions are remembered by Chrome and you should not be asked again for the same site.
  </section>

  <section class="padding-2">
    <img alt="screen shot" class="illustration" src="img/new_speed_control_bar.png">
    After zooming, clicking the Video Maximizer button shows extra options to control playback speed.
  </section>

  <h3>Why speed control fails on some sites</h3>
  <section class="padding-2">
    <img alt="screen shot" class="illustration" src="img/permissions_prompt.png">
    When pages load their videos from a different site (e.g. a youtube video embedded in a non-youtube site), then
    the speed control feature will not work without permissions to both sites.<br/><br/>
    If this happens, you can try rezooming a couple of times and see if more Access prompts show up. Yes, the
    multiple promptings can be annoying, but it's just how Chrome works and you will only be asked once per site.<br>
    If you grant permissions, then you will NOT be prompted again.<br/><br/>
    If you continue to have access issues or find the prompting annoying there are extra permissions you can try
    in the Video Maxmizer Options page.
  </section>
    <section class="padding-2">
    The <b>"Allow access to all sites by default"</b> in the <a href="options.html" target="videomaxoptions">Options</a> will
    increase this extension's base permissions.<br/><br/>
      <b>Privacy thoughts</b>: when granting sites individual permissions, Chrome saves the list of domains with the extension.
      (See Chrome's Extension page, then click "Details" for the extension.) This list is <b>preserved</b> even if you delete your
      browsing history. If this is a concern for you, then enabling <b>"Allow access to all sites by default"</b> will grant
      Video Maximizer access to sites when you activate the extension, but the internal Chrome list will no longer track it.
      <br/><br/>
    The fundamental issue is how the cross-domain-frame-permissions-granting works in Chrome. See <a
      href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=826433" rel="noopener"

  <h3>
    Known issues
  </h3>
  <section class="padding-7">
    <h4>Youtube controls are not fullscreen</h4>
    <p>The solution for this is to put the youtube video into "Youtube theater" mode before using Video Maximizer. This
      can be
      done by pressing the "T" key.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Skipping doesn't work on Netflix</h4>
    <p>Skipping the video backwards on netflix causes an error. There's no workaround, so this feature is just disabled
      for now.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Speed controls don't work on some sites</h4>
    <p>Video Maximizer attempts to use the minimal permissions required to do its job. However, there are still some
      sites that require more access to work.
      (The technical reason has to do with embedding iframes that have cross-domain references.)</p>
    <p>The default settings for Video Maximizer is maximum privacy, but see the <a href="options.html"
                                                                                    target="videomaxoptions">Options</a>
      page for more choices to grant this extension more permissions.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Disabling "Allow access to all sites by default" doesn't reset permissions</h4>
    <p>Another Chrome issue. Video Maximizer removes the extra permissions; however, since they've already been granted,
      it seems like the extension must be uninstalled and reinstalled to reset it.</p>

    <br/>
    <h4>Constant security prompting</h4>
    <p>You should only get prompted ONCE per unique site you use Video Maximizer on; however, if this frequency annoys
      you, then
      you have the choice to enable the "Allow access to all sites by default" option. You will then get one last prompt
      and never be bugged again.</p>

    Using with local video files
  </h3>

  <section class="padding-7">
    <p>You can use Video Maximizer with local video files (like .mp4).
      Simply drag-and-drop into a browser window to start playing the video. Then click the extension button.
    </p>
    <p>If you have issues with local files working, you may want to check the extension permissions.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go into Chrome Extensions page <code>chrome://extensions/</code></li>
      <li>Find the VideoMaximizer in the list of extensions.</li>
      <li>Click the Details button</li>
      <li>Scroll down until you see the "Allow access to file URLs" and make sure it's enabled.</li>
    </ol>
    You can disable the speed controls and revert the behavior back to the classic toggle.
