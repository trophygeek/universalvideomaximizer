  <h3>Chrome Update Bug Warning</h3>
  <section class="padding-1">
    <p>There is currently a bug with Chrome that impacts ALL extensions. Right after an update, extensions can <span
        class="emphasis">just stop
      working.</span> There are two user workaround.</p>
    <p>The first is to restart Chrome.</p>
    <p> The second is to go to <code>Manage Extensions</code> under the
      puzzle piece in the Chrome toolbar. Then enable <code>Developer mode</code> and manually reload the extension.
    </p>
    <p class="is-center"><img alt="how to manually reload an extension" src="img/chrome_update_bug.png"><br/></p>
    <p>Hopefully this will be fixed soon and only seems to show up after the extension is modified.
      See
      <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1316588" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Issue
        #1316588</a> for more information. But this trick is handy for all extensions until it's resolved.</p>

  <h3>Reporting other issues</h3>
  <section class="padding-1">
    Any problems or feature requests should be reported here via a
    <a href="https://github.com/trophygeek/universalvideomaximizer/issues" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub
      issue</a>. Chrome's reporting feature in the store does not notifying when new issues are added.
  </section>

  <section class="padding-1">
    As always, this extension is:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="emphasis bold">FREE</span>

      <li>Requires minimal permissions to increase security and privacy
      </li>

      <li><span class="emphasis">NEVER collects ANY data</span>. Privacy is a top priority.
      </li>

      <li>Is <a href="https://github.com/trophygeek/universalvideomaximizer/" rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank">open-sourced</a> for transparency.

  <h3>New playback speed option</h3>
  <section class="padding-3">
    <img alt="screen shot" class="illustration" src="img/speed_change_yes.png">
    Playback speed cannot work on pages where videos are actually hosted on a different site. (e.g. youtube videos not
    on the youtube site). This is a limitation of the Chrome Extension API itself.<br/><br/>
    When a site looks like it supports speed control, the toolbar icon will display a <img alt="playback indicator icon"
                                                                                           src="img/playback_indicator.png">
    overlay
  </section>


  <section class="padding-5">
    <img alt="screen shot" class="illustration" src="img/new_speed_control_bar.png">
    When the speed control graphics is displayed, clicking the button shows extra options to control playback speed.
  </section>


  <h3>Why speed control fails on some sites</h3>
  <section class="padding-3">
    <img alt="screen shot" class="illustration" src="img/speed_change_no.png">
    When pages load their videos from a different site (e.g. a youtube video embedded in a non youtube site), then
    the speed control feature often will not work.<br/><br/>
    If this happens, there's a setting to try.
    "Allow access to all sites by default" in the <a href="options.html" target="videomaxoptions">Options</a> will
    increase this extension's permissions.<br/><br/>
    The fundamental issue is that cross-domain-frame-permissions-granting doesn't work
    in Chrome yet. See <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=826433" rel="noreferrer"

  <h3>
    Known issues
  </h3>
  <section class="padding-7">
    <h4>Youtube controls are not fullscreen</h4>
    <p>The solution for this is to put the youtube video into "theater" mode before using Video Maximizer. This can be
      done by pressing the "t" key.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Skipping doesn't work on Netflix</h4>
    <p>Skipping the video backwards on netflix causes an error. There's no workaround, so this feature is just disabled
      for now.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Speed controls don't work on some sites</h4>
    <p>Video Maximizer attempts to use the minimal permissions required to do it's job. However, there are still some
      sites that require full access to every domain to work.
      (technical reason has to do with embedding iframes that have cross-domain references).</p>
    <p>The only current work around is to enable "Allow access to all sites by default" in Video Maximizer's
      Options.</p>
    <p>There's an open Chrome issue/feature request to allow this to work without needing this extreme access.</p>

    <br/>

    <h4>Disabling "Allow access to all sites by default" doesn't reset permissions</h4>
    <p>Another Chrome issue. Video Maximizer removes the extra permissions; however, since they've already been granted,
      it seems like the extension must be uninstalled and reinstalled to reset it.</p>

    <br/>
    <h4>Constant security prompting</h4>
    <p>You should only get prompted ONCE per unique site you use Video Maximizer on; however, if this annoys you, then
      you have the choice to enable the "Allow access to all sites by default" option. You will then get one last prompt
      and never be bugged again.</p>

  <h3>
    Changing Options
  </h3>

  <section class="padding-7">
    <img alt="screenshot showing how to show options page" class="illustration" src="img/tips2.png">
    <ol>
      <li><span class="bold">Right-click</span> the icon</li>
      <li>Select Option from the dropdown menu.
      </li>
    </ol>
    You can disable the speed controls and revert the behavior back to the classic toggle.
